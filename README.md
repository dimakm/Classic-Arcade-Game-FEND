HOW TO PLAY:

In this game the goal is to get the hero character to move to the water without getting hit by the enemy bugs. The score increases each time the hero arrives to the water.  

The hero moves by clicking the arrow keys in the keyboard .

The hero has 3 lives, the number decreases and a sound plays each time she is hit by a bug, when the lives number is 0 the game is over. 

You can play it again by clicking Play again in the Game Over screen.
